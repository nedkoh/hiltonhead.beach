The Sea Pines Resort stands as Hilton Head Island's original and most prestigious golf destination. Home to three championship courses set amid stunning Lowcountry landscapes, Sea Pines offers an unmatched golf experience that attracts players from around the world. From the legendary Harbour Town Golf Links, site of the PGA Tour's RBC Heritage, to the player-friendly Heron Point and the beautifully restored Atlantic Dunes, Sea Pines delivers world-class golf for every skill level. This comprehensive guide will help you choose the right course, plan your rounds, and make the most of your Sea Pines golf experience.

## The Three Championship Courses

### Harbour Town Golf Links

**The Icon**

Harbour Town Golf Links is more than a golf course - it's a landmark in golf history. Designed by the legendary Pete Dye with consultation from Jack Nicklaus, this course opened in 1969 and immediately changed the landscape of golf course architecture.

**Course Details:**
- **Par:** 71
- **Yardage:** 7,099 yards (Championship)
- **Designer:** Pete Dye with Jack Nicklaus
- **Opened:** 1969
- **Home of:** RBC Heritage (PGA Tour Signature Event)

**What Makes It Special:**

Harbour Town places a premium on finesse, imagination, and shot-making rather than power. The greens average just 3,700 square feet - significantly smaller than the PGA Tour average of 6,600 square feet - demanding precise approaches. Narrow fairways lined with ancient oaks and strategic bunkering create a thinking player's paradise.

The 18th hole, with the iconic red and white striped Harbour Town Lighthouse framing the green, is one of golf's most recognizable and photographed finishing holes. Standing on that tee with Calibogue Sound stretching beyond the green is a bucket-list moment for any golfer.

**2025-2026 Restoration:**

Following the 2025 RBC Heritage, Harbour Town underwent its most extensive renovation since 2000. Davis Love III, five-time RBC Heritage champion, led the restoration with a mission to honor Pete Dye's original vision while preparing the course for modern play. The course reopened in November 2025, offering players a chance to be among the first to experience the restored masterpiece.

**Best For:** Low handicappers seeking a championship challenge, golf history enthusiasts, those wanting to walk in the footsteps of PGA Tour pros.

### Heron Point by Pete Dye

**The Resort Favorite**

Don't let the Pete Dye name intimidate you - Heron Point exemplifies what a great resort course should be. It appears more difficult than it actually plays, making it enjoyable for golfers of all skill levels while still offering strategic challenges for accomplished players.

**Course Details:**
- **Par:** 72
- **Yardage:** 7,000+ yards (Championship), 5,500 yards (Forward)
- **Designer:** Pete Dye
- **Opened:** 2007 (converted from Sea Marsh course)

**What Makes It Special:**

Dye was commissioned to convert the former Sea Marsh course into Heron Point, and he delivered a layout featuring wider fairways than Harbour Town with water and bunkers as the protagonists. The fairways move toward and away from hazards, while Dye's signature mounding and swales frame target areas throughout.

Six different tee sets accommodate every skill level, from beginners at 5,500 yards to accomplished players stretching it out past 7,000 yards.

**Notable Holes:**
- **Hole 1:** A scenic opener with bunkers and water lining the right side
- **Hole 2:** Short but demanding par 4 with an elevated green and dangerous back bunker
- **Hole 8:** The number one handicap hole, a 420-yard par 4 challenge
- **Hole 11:** The longest hole at 617 yards, a true three-shot par 5
- **Hole 18:** An intimidating finisher with water running the entire left side from tee to green

**Best For:** Mid to high handicappers wanting a beautiful Dye design without extreme difficulty, resort guests seeking accessible championship golf.

### Atlantic Dunes by Davis Love III

**The Historic Renovation**

Atlantic Dunes represents a complete reconstruction of the Ocean Course, which was Hilton Head Island's very first golf course. Davis Love III modernized the layout to accommodate contemporary shot values while preserving the coastal character that made the original course special.

**Course Details:**
- **Par:** 72
- **Yardage:** 6,800+ yards (Championship)
- **Designer:** Davis Love III
- **Opened:** 2017 (reconstruction)
- **Award:** National Course of the Year 2018

**What Makes It Special:**

Atlantic Dunes delivers a pronounced Lowcountry experience accented by coquina shells and seaside grass. Tens of thousands of indigenous plants create an authentic coastal atmosphere. The playing surfaces feature the same cutting-edge grasses used at Harbour Town and Heron Point.

Strategic bunkering rewards golfers who use them as aiming points while punishing mediocre shots. The course plays through beautiful Spanish moss-draped oaks with water hazards on nearly every hole.

**Notable Holes:**
- **Hole 1:** Wide fairway with lagoon right, green protected by bunkers front left
- **Hole 3:** Par 5 heading toward the ocean, "punchbowl" green rewards accurate yardages
- **Hole 15:** Long par 3 into the ocean breeze, featuring the deepest bunker on the course
- **Hole 16:** Short par 4 with multiple tee shot options, "Lion's Mouth" green divided by a fronting bunker
- **Hole 18:** Longest par 4 on the course, finishing among bunkers and dunes

**Best For:** Players who appreciate strategic golf, those seeking an authentic Lowcountry experience, course architecture enthusiasts.
