Standing on the 18th tee at Harbour Town Golf Links, with the iconic red and white striped lighthouse framing your target, you'll understand why this course is considered one of golf's most memorable experiences. Designed by the legendary Pete Dye with consultation from Jack Nicklaus, Harbour Town has hosted the PGA Tour's RBC Heritage since 1969 and remains a bucket-list destination for golfers worldwide. This comprehensive guide will help you make the most of your round at this historic Hilton Head Island treasure.

## Course Overview

Harbour Town Golf Links opened in 1969 and immediately captured the golf world's attention when Arnold Palmer won the inaugural Heritage Golf Classic. Palmer famously described Harbour Town as "a thinking man's course," and that assessment remains accurate today.

### Key Course Statistics
- **Par:** 71
- **Total Yardage:** 7,099 yards (Championship tees)
- **Designer:** Pete Dye with Jack Nicklaus consultation
- **Green Size:** Average 3,700 square feet (PGA Tour average is 6,600 sq ft)
- **Grass Type:** Bermuda grass greens

What sets Harbour Town apart is its emphasis on finesse, imagination, and shot-making over raw power. The narrow fairways, small greens, and strategic bunkering reward players who can think their way around the course rather than overpower it.

## The 2025-2026 Course Restoration

Harbour Town underwent an extensive renovation following the 2025 RBC Heritage, the most significant work since a 2000 renovation. Davis Love III, who has won the RBC Heritage five times, led the restoration with a mission to find the "best of Pete Dye."

The restoration focused on honoring Dye's original vision while preparing the course for modern play. Love approached the project with deep respect, noting he didn't want his name on the scorecard as a designer out of reverence for Dye's masterpiece.

## Famous Holes at Harbour Town

### Hole 8: The Most Difficult
The number one handicap hole at Harbour Town, this demanding par 4 requires precision from tee to green. A well-placed drive is essential to avoid water and strategically placed trees. The key is hitting it long and right off the tee to have a decent approach shot clear of trees, bunkers, and lagoons.

### Hole 9: The Driveable Par 4
Playing around 325 yards, this tight par 4 tempts aggressive players to reach the green from the tee. However, Pete Dye is counting on you to make a mistake. As local wisdom suggests: "What's wrong with two 150-yard shots, keeping the ball in play, and easily finding the green?"

### Hole 13: Alice Dye's Masterpiece
When Pete Dye encountered designer's block on the 13th hole, his wife Alice grabbed a napkin and sketched a dogleg. The result is one of golf's most unique green sites - an island green surrounded entirely by sand and supported by railroad ties. Missing the green presents a brutal sand save scenario.

### Hole 17: The Calibogue Sound Par 3
At 198 yards, this stunning par 3 sits exposed to the winds whipping off Calibogue Sound. Trees no longer protect the green, leaving players to contend with headwinds at the tee box or crosswinds pushing directly toward water on the left.

### Hole 18: The Signature Finish
One of golf's most recognizable finishing holes, the 472-yard par 4 features the Harbour Town Lighthouse standing sentinel behind the green. The wide landing area juts into Calibogue Sound, and the long approach offers bailout to the right - but beware the innocent-looking mounding that has cost many players their par.

## Tips for Playing Harbour Town

### 1. Accuracy Over Power
With narrow fairways and the smallest greens on the PGA Tour, precision trumps distance at Harbour Town. Leave the driver in the bag when in doubt.

### 2. Beware of Overhanging Trees
Even fairway shots can be blocked by overhanging trees on holes 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16. Position your tee shots strategically to leave straight approaches.

### 3. Know Your Yardages
The small greens demand accurate distance control. Trust your numbers and commit to each shot.

### 4. Factor in the Wind
The final holes play along Calibogue Sound, where wind conditions can dramatically affect club selection. Study the wind before playing holes 17 and 18.

### 5. Choose the Right Tees
This may be the most important decision you make all day. Harbour Town is playable by all skill levels, but many golfers play courses too long for their abilities. Remember, you're there to enjoy the experience, not win the RBC Heritage.

### 6. Consider a Caddy
Since 2007, The Sea Pines Resort has offered walking caddies and forecaddies at all three courses. These seasoned professionals provide invaluable insights on course management, club selection, and green reading.
