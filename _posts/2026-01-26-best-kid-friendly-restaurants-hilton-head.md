## Essential Dining Tips for Families

### Make Reservations Early

Hilton Head restaurants fill up quickly, especially during summer months. Book at least a week in advance for popular spots, and consider using apps like Resy or OpenTable to secure your table.

### Time Your Meals Strategically

- **Lunch:** Often easier with kids, shorter waits, better pricing
- **Early dinner:** Aim for 5:00-5:30 PM to beat the rush
- **Avoid peak hours:** 6:30-8:00 PM typically sees the longest waits

### Choose Locations Wisely

Consider your day's activities when selecting restaurants:

- **Beach day?** Choose restaurants near Coligny Plaza
- **Exploring Sea Pines?** Dine at Harbour Town
- **Staying near Shelter Cove?** Enjoy the variety of options nearby

### Embrace the Casual Vibe

Hilton Head dining leans casual. Most restaurants welcome families in beach attire, though you may want to throw on a cover-up or fresh shirt for nicer establishments.

### Have a Backup Plan

Even with reservations, travel with kids requires flexibility. Identify 2-3 restaurant options in your planned area so you have alternatives if plans change.
