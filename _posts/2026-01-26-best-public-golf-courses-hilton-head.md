Hilton Head Island has been a premier golf destination since 1962, and today the Lowcountry boasts over 26 championship courses designed by legendary architects including Pete Dye, Robert Trent Jones Sr., and Jack Nicklaus. Golf Digest readers have ranked Hilton Head as the 10th best golf destination in the world, and for good reason. Here are the best public golf courses you can play during your Hilton Head vacation.

## Harbour Town Golf Links at Sea Pines Resort

No conversation about Hilton Head golf is complete without mentioning **Harbour Town Golf Links**, the crown jewel of island golf. Since 1969, this Pete Dye masterpiece has hosted the PGA TOUR's RBC Heritage tournament, making it integral to American golf history.

Following the 2025 RBC Heritage, Harbour Town underwent an extensive restoration overseen by Davis Love III and his design company. The project, completed in November 2025, restored and preserved Dye's original strategic intent while modernizing the course for today's game.

**Course Details:**
- Par: 71
- Yardage: 7,099 from the tips
- Difficulty: Challenging for all skill levels
- Green Fees: $350-$450 (varies seasonally)
- Signature Hole: The iconic 18th with its lighthouse backdrop

**Booking Tip:** Book at least 30 days in advance during peak season. Sea Pines Resort guests receive priority tee times.

## Palmetto Dunes Resort Courses

Palmetto Dunes offers three distinct championship courses, making it an excellent choice for golfers who want variety during their stay.

The star of Palmetto Dunes, this course features wide fairways, strategic bunkering, and one of the island's only oceanfront holes. The dramatic par-5 10th hole runs along the Atlantic Ocean and is consistently rated among the finest holes in the Southeast.

## Hilton Head National

Located just one mile from the bridges leading onto the island, **Hilton Head National** is an excellent venue for a round on your arrival or departure day. Gary Player collaborated with Bobby Weed to create this demanding yet fair layout.
