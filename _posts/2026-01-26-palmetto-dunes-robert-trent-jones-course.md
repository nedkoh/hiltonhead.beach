The Robert Trent Jones Oceanfront Course at Palmetto Dunes stands as one of the crown jewels of Hilton Head Island golf. Named South Carolina's Golf Course of the Year, this championship layout offers something rare in Lowcountry golf: a genuine oceanfront hole with panoramic views of the Atlantic. For golfers visiting Hilton Head, a round at the Jones course is an essential experience that combines world-class design with unforgettable coastal scenery.

## Course Overview and History

Designed by the legendary Robert Trent Jones Sr. and later renovated by his associate Roger Rulewich, the course embodies Jones's signature philosophy of providing "tough par, easy bogey" golf. The renovation restored bunkers to their original design intent while adding a new lake that enhances both the challenge and aesthetics of the layout.

This par-72 course offers five sets of tees to accommodate golfers of varying abilities:

- **Championship tees**: 7,005 yards
- **Blue tees**: Approximately 6,500 yards
- **White tees**: 6,122 yards (most popular)
- **Gold tees**: Approximately 5,600 yards
- **Red tees**: Approximately 5,100 yards

The versatility of the tee options means everyone from scratch golfers to beginners can enjoy a memorable round at their appropriate challenge level.

## Signature Features and Design Elements

### Wide Fairways and Forgiving Design

Unlike some of the more penal layouts on Hilton Head, the Robert Trent Jones course features generous fairways that welcome golfers of all skill levels. You'll find room to swing without fear of immediate disaster, making this an excellent choice for mid-to-high handicappers seeking an enjoyable rather than punishing round.

### Lagoon Play

Eleven holes on the course play through or alongside the lagoon system, adding both beauty and strategic challenge. The water forces thoughtful club selection and shot placement, particularly on approach shots where lagoons guard greens.

### Expansive Greens

True to Jones's design philosophy, the greens are large and inviting, rewarding accurate approach shots while still providing challenging putting surfaces. Subtle breaks and multi-tiered designs keep even skilled putters on their toes.

### Elevation Changes

For Lowcountry golf, the Jones course offers surprising elevation variation. These subtle changes add visual interest and affect club selection in ways that make each hole unique.

## The Famous 10th Hole: Oceanfront Golf at Its Best

The par-5 10th hole is the undisputed star of the Robert Trent Jones course and one of the most photographed golf holes in South Carolina. This is one of only two oceanfront holes on all of Hilton Head Island, making it a must-play for any golfer visiting the area.

The hole plays as a reachable par 5 for longer hitters but offers risk-reward decisions throughout. The elevated green provides panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean that will have you reaching for your camera before your putter. Many golfers consider standing on this green to be the most memorable moment of their Hilton Head golf trip.

**Tips for Playing the 10th**:
- Take time to enjoy the views from the green, regardless of your score
- Wind off the ocean significantly affects shot selection
- The elevated green plays longer than it appears
- Morning rounds offer the best lighting for photos

## Notable Holes Worth Knowing

### 5th Hole (Par 3, 204 yards)

The first of four strong par 3s on the course, the 5th sets the tone for what's to come. At just over 200 yards from the back tee, this hole demands a quality long iron or hybrid shot. The green complex is well-protected and requires precision to find the putting surface.

### 7th Hole (Par 4, No. 1 Handicap)

This is the most difficult hole on the course, earning the No. 1 handicap designation. The hole requires two quality shots to reach the green in regulation. A well-positioned drive leaves a mid-iron approach, but miss the fairway and you'll struggle to make par.

### 8th Hole (Par 3, 227 yards)

At 227 yards from the championship tees, this par 3 plays like a short par 4 for many golfers. Club selection is crucial, and finding the green in regulation here is an accomplishment to be proud of. Most players should consider playing up a tee to enjoy this hole rather than battle it.

### 17th Hole (Par 3)

Despite being the No. 16 handicap hole (meaning it's considered one of the easier holes), the 17th provides a pleasant late-round test. It's a chance to make a birdie heading into the challenging finishing hole.

### 18th Hole (Par 4, Sharp Dogleg Left)

The finishing hole is a dramatic sharp dogleg left that requires strategic thinking off the tee. Cut too much off the corner and you risk finding trouble; play too safe and you leave a long approach. It's a hole that can make or break a good round.

## Tips for Playing Your Best Round

**Choose the Right Tees**: Don't let ego guide your tee selection. The white tees at 6,122 yards provide plenty of challenge for most golfers while keeping the round enjoyable.

**Respect the Wind**: Ocean breezes are constant on Hilton Head, and they affect ball flight significantly. Plan for 1-2 clubs difference on windy days.

**Course Management Pays Off**: The wide fairways reward aggressive play, but the lagoons demand respect. When water is in play, take enough club to carry it comfortably.

**Hydrate**: Especially in warmer months, the Lowcountry heat and humidity can be intense. Bring water and take advantage of beverage cart service.

**Play Early or Late**: Morning rounds offer cooler temperatures and often calmer winds. Late afternoon rounds provide beautiful lighting but may be rushed before sunset.

**Enjoy the Experience**: The Jones course is meant to be enjoyed, not conquered. Take in the scenery, especially on the ocean holes, and don't let a bad hole ruin your day.

## Booking Your Round

Advance reservations are recommended, particularly during peak season (spring and fall). Tee times can be booked online through the Palmetto Dunes website or by phone. Green fees vary by season, with premium pricing during the most popular months.

Consider golf packages that combine rounds at multiple Palmetto Dunes courses for the best value. The resort often offers stay-and-play packages that include accommodations.
