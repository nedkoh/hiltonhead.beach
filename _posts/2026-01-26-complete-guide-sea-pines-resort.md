Sea Pines Resort stands as Hilton Head Island's crown jewel, a 5,000-acre gated community that pioneered the concept of environmentally responsible resort development. Located on the southern tip of the island, Sea Pines offers visitors an unparalleled combination of natural beauty, world-class amenities, and that distinctive Lowcountry charm that keeps families returning year after year.

## The Heart of Sea Pines: Harbour Town

No visit to Sea Pines is complete without exploring Harbour Town, the resort's picturesque village center that has become synonymous with Hilton Head Island itself. The iconic red-and-white striped Harbour Town Lighthouse rises 90 feet above the yacht basin, serving as both a working navigational aid and the island's most photographed landmark.

### The Lighthouse Experience

Built in 1970 as the first privately financed lighthouse since the early 1800s, the Harbour Town Lighthouse offers visitors a unique experience. Climb the 114 steps to reach the observation deck, where you will be treated to sweeping views of Calibogue Sound and the surrounding Lowcountry landscape. The journey up takes you through a museum showcasing the rich maritime history of Hilton Head Island.

The lighthouse gift shop at the base offers souvenirs, and the beacon itself flashes white every two and a half seconds, guiding boats through the Intracoastal Waterway.

### Shopping and Dining at Harbour Town

The charming village surrounding the yacht basin features:

- **More than 20 restaurants** ranging from upscale waterfront dining to casual cafes
- **Boutique shopping** with local artisan goods and resort wear
- **Ice cream parlors and bakeries** perfect for an afternoon treat
- **Live entertainment** at various venues throughout the week
- **Sidewalk cafes** ideal for people-watching

The atmosphere at Harbour Town feels distinctly European, with cobblestone walkways winding past colorful storefronts while sailboats bob gently in the marina below.

### The Liberty Oak

Near the yacht basin stands the centuries-old Liberty Oak, a massive moss-draped tree that creates a stunning natural canopy. This majestic oak has witnessed generations of visitors and serves as a popular gathering spot and photography location, especially during sunset hours.

## World-Class Golf at Sea Pines

Sea Pines has earned its reputation as a golfer's paradise, home to four exceptional courses that challenge players while showcasing the island's natural beauty.

### Harbour Town Golf Links

The crown jewel of Sea Pines golf, Harbour Town Golf Links hosts the PGA Tour's RBC Heritage tournament each April. Designed by Pete Dye and Jack Nicklaus, this iconic course features:

- Narrow fairways lined with moss-draped oaks
- Small, well-defended greens
- The famous 18th hole finishing alongside Calibogue Sound
- Views of the lighthouse from multiple holes

Green fees reflect the course's prestige, but playing where the pros compete creates an unforgettable experience.

### Atlantic Dunes by Davis Love III

Redesigned by Hilton Head native and major champion Davis Love III, Atlantic Dunes offers stunning ocean views and a layout that emphasizes playability while maintaining challenge. The restoration preserved the original routing while enhancing the natural dune features.

### Heron Point by Pete Dye

Another Pete Dye creation, Heron Point meanders through Sea Pines' interior landscape of forests, lagoons, and marshland. The course offers a more serene experience than Harbour Town while maintaining excellent conditioning and strategic interest.

### Sea Pines Country Club Course

Available exclusively to members and resort guests, this course provides a classic Lowcountry golf experience with mature trees and water features throughout.

## Five Miles of Pristine Beaches

Sea Pines offers direct access to some of Hilton Head's finest beaches. The resort's five miles of oceanfront provide:

- **Uncrowded stretches of sand** perfect for long walks
- **Excellent shelling opportunities**, especially at low tide
- **Calm waters** ideal for swimming and wading with children
- **Beach equipment rentals** including chairs, umbrellas, and kayaks
- **Lifeguards** stationed at select beach access points during peak season

The hard-packed sand characteristic of Hilton Head beaches makes them perfect for biking and jogging right along the water's edge.

## Water Activities and Adventures

The Harbour Town Yacht Basin serves as the launching point for countless maritime adventures:

- **Dolphin watching cruises** departing multiple times daily
- **Sunset sailing excursions** aboard classic vessels
- **Deep-sea fishing charters** targeting offshore species
- **Kayak and paddleboard rentals** for exploring the marshes
- **Parasailing** for aerial views of the island
- **Jet ski rentals** for high-speed fun

For families, the combination of guided tours and self-guided exploration ensures everyone finds their perfect water activity.

## Nature and Recreation

Sea Pines dedicates 1,300 acres to parks, forests, and natural preserves, reflecting the community's founding commitment to environmental stewardship.

- Miles of hiking and biking trails

### Biking Trails
