Coligny Plaza stands as the beating heart of Hilton Head Island, a vibrant shopping and entertainment district that has served as the island's de facto downtown since 1955. Located at the intersection of Pope Avenue and Coligny Circle, this open-air shopping center offers over 60 specialty shops, more than 20 restaurants, and direct access to one of the island's most popular beaches. Whether you are seeking a quick beach lunch, an evening of entertainment, or a full day of retail therapy, Coligny Plaza delivers an experience unlike anywhere else on Hilton Head.

## The History of Coligny Plaza

Founded in 1955 by Lois and Norris Richardson, Coligny Plaza holds the distinction of being Hilton Head Island's first commercial development. The plaza housed the island's original grocery store and first movie theater, establishing itself as the community gathering place that it remains today.

Over the decades, Coligny has evolved from a small cluster of shops serving the island's early residents into a sprawling entertainment complex known far and wide as "Hilton Head's Downtown." Despite the growth, the plaza retains its open-air, beach-town character that distinguishes it from mainland shopping malls.
