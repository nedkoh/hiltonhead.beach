## Tips for Playing Hilton Head Courses

### Course Strategy
1. **Respect the Lowcountry:** Many courses feature lagoons, marshes, and water hazards. Play conservatively around water.

4. **Wildlife encounters:** Alligators are common near water hazards. Admire from a distance and never retrieve balls from the water's edge.

### What to Bring
