Palmetto Dunes Oceanfront Resort stands as one of the premier golf destinations on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Spanning 2,000 acres along three miles of pristine Atlantic Ocean beachfront, this world-class resort offers golfers an unmatched experience with three distinct championship courses, each designed by legendary architects. Whether you're a low-handicap player seeking a challenge or a weekend golfer looking for a memorable round, Palmetto Dunes delivers excellence at every turn.

## Three World-Class Golf Courses

What makes Palmetto Dunes truly exceptional is its collection of three championship courses, each offering a unique playing experience. All three courses have earned four stars or higher from Golf Digest's Places to Play ratings, testament to the quality of design and course conditions.

### Robert Trent Jones Oceanfront Course

The crown jewel of Palmetto Dunes, the Robert Trent Jones Course was named South Carolina's Golf Course of the Year. This par-72 layout stretches over 7,000 yards from the championship tees but offers five sets of tees to accommodate all skill levels.

The course's signature feature is the par-5 10th hole, one of only two oceanfront holes on all of Hilton Head Island. The panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean from the elevated green create one of the most memorable golf experiences in the Lowcountry. The course features wide fairways, expansive greens, and subtle elevation changes that showcase Jones's masterful design philosophy.

### Arthur Hills Course

Opened in 1986, the Arthur Hills Course has earned a legendary reputation, having hosted college golf tournaments featuring future legends like Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and David Duval during their collegiate years. This par-72 layout emphasizes accuracy and precision over raw distance.

The course's distinctive characteristic is its lack of fairway bunkers, replaced instead by natural mounding and contouring that creates challenging off-balance lies. With lagoons winding through 10 different holes and ever-present ocean breezes, the Hills course demands strategic play. The course is also home to the historic Hilton Head Range Light Station, a Lowcountry landmark that guided ships into Port Royal Sound beginning in the late 1800s.

### George Fazio Course

The George Fazio Course is Hilton Head Island's only public par-70 layout and is widely regarded as the most challenging course on the island. Playing just under 7,000 yards from the tips, this layout features a slope and rating of 74/145 from the back tees, making it a true test for accomplished golfers.

With only two par 5s, the heart of the Fazio course lies in a series of demanding par 4s, beginning with the 432-yard first hole and culminating with the 462-yard 18th. The front nine features open, tree-lined fairways, while the back nine becomes progressively tighter. The course was named to Golf Digest's list of America's 100 Best at a remarkably young age and recently earned South Carolina Golf Course of the Year honors.

| Par | 72 | 72 | 70 |
