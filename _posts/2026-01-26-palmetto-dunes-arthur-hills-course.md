The Arthur Hills Course at Palmetto Dunes holds a special place in golf history. This is where future legends Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and David Duval competed during their college years, testing their games on a layout that emphasizes precision and strategic thinking over raw power. Opened in 1986, the course has earned its reputation as one of South Carolina's most unique and rewarding golf experiences, offering challenges that even the world's best found worthy of their talents.

## A Course Unlike Any Other on Hilton Head

What makes the Arthur Hills Course immediately distinctive is what it lacks: fairway bunkers. When the course opened in the mid-1980s, designer Arthur Hills intentionally omitted bunkers from the fairways, instead relying on natural mounding and contouring to protect holes. While the resort has since added rough to define the holes, with fewer than 20 bunkers in play on the entire course, the prominent mounding remains the layout's signature feature.

This design philosophy creates a different kind of challenge. Without bunkers to avoid, golfers must instead navigate:

- **Off-balance lies** from the dramatic mounding
- **Ever-present ocean breezes** that affect ball flight
- **An extensive network of lagoons** winding through 10 different holes
- **Continuous lines of dunes** and thick stands of palmettos

The result is a course that rewards accuracy and course management over distance, making it ideal for thinking golfers who enjoy plotting their way around a layout.

## Course Layout and Playing Characteristics

### Course Statistics

- **Par**: 72
- **Yardage**: 6,651 yards from the back tees
- **Design**: Arthur Hills (opened 1986)
- **Location**: Leamington community within Palmetto Dunes

### The Front Nine: Open and Strategic

The front nine at Arthur Hills features a more open character, with large live oaks weaving in and out of play. The generous width off the tee can be deceiving, however. The mounding creates uneven lies that make approach shots more challenging than they appear from the fairway.

Key strategic considerations on the front nine:
- Position your tee shots to avoid the worst of the mounding
- Lagoons come into play early, demanding respect
- Ocean breezes are more exposed without dense tree cover
- Large oaks can block recovery shots from errant drives

### The Back Nine: Tighter and More Demanding

The back nine at Arthur Hills represents a noticeable increase in difficulty. The holes become tighter, with more forced carries and water coming into play more frequently. Golfers who played conservatively on the front may need to take more risks on the back to maintain their scores.

Characteristics of the back nine:
- Tighter tree-lined corridors
- More aggressive lagoon positioning
- Greater emphasis on accurate driving
- Premium on hitting greens in regulation

## Historic Landmark: Hilton Head Range Light Station

One of the unique features of the Arthur Hills Course is its proximity to the Hilton Head Range Light Station, one of the Lowcountry's most historic lighthouses. This structure guided ships into Port Royal Sound beginning in the late 1800s and stands as a reminder of the island's rich maritime heritage.

The lighthouse provides a distinctive backdrop for several holes and makes for excellent photography during your round. It's a reminder that Hilton Head Island offers history and culture alongside its world-class golf.

## Playing Tips for the Arthur Hills Course

### Embrace the Mounding

Don't fight the contours; work with them. The mounding will create uneven lies, so:
- Practice hitting from uneven lies before your round
- Take one more club when hitting uphill or from an uneven stance
- Accept that some lies will be difficult and plan accordingly

### Respect the Lagoons

With water in play on 10 holes, the lagoons are your primary hazard. Smart strategy includes:
- Taking enough club to carry water comfortably
- Aiming away from water when in doubt
- Recognizing that the back nine demands more precise water carries
- Knowing where bailout areas exist on each hole

### Play for Position

The Arthur Hills Course rewards position over power. Consider:
- Laying up to your preferred approach distance
- Keeping the ball in play rather than maximizing distance
- Using clubs you're confident with off the tee
- Prioritizing the short grass over extra yards

### Adjust for Wind

Ocean breezes affect every shot at Palmetto Dunes. On the Hills course:
- Morning rounds typically feature calmer conditions
- Afternoon winds can add 2-3 clubs to shots
- Crosswinds significantly affect ball flight on open holes
- Learn to flight the ball lower when conditions demand

### Manage Expectations

The course's mounding and wind create unpredictable conditions. Your best approach:
- Accept that some shots will end up in difficult positions
- Stay patient when the course presents challenges
- Celebrate good shots and learn from poor ones
- Remember that even Tiger Woods found this course challenging

## Practice Facilities and Warm-Up

Before your round at Arthur Hills, take advantage of the full practice facilities:

- **Driving Range**: Warm up your full swing and find your rhythm
- **Short Game Area**: Practice the pitch and chip shots you'll need around the mounded greens
- **Putting Green**: Get comfortable with the speed and break of the greens

A proper warm-up is especially important at Arthur Hills because the course immediately tests your ball-striking. Showing up without warming up often leads to a slow start.

## Clubhouse and Amenities

### Arthur's Grill

After your round, Arthur's Grill provides the perfect setting to relax and reflect. The patio overlooking the course offers casual dining with views of the holes you just played. It's an ideal spot to discuss the round over food and drinks.

### Pro Shop

The clubhouse pro shop features:
- Quality apparel and merchandise
- Equipment and accessories
- Friendly staff with course knowledge
- Club rentals if needed

### Hours of Operation

The Arthur Hills Course operates from 6:30 AM to 4:00 PM daily. Early morning tee times are popular, especially in warmer months when golfers want to avoid the afternoon heat.

## What Makes Arthur Hills Special

Playing the Arthur Hills Course offers something different from typical resort golf. You're walking (or riding) the same holes that challenged future major champions during formative moments in their careers. The unique design philosophy, which removes fairway bunkers in favor of natural contouring, creates strategic questions you won't face anywhere else on Hilton Head.

The combination of:
- Historic significance (hosting legendary players)
- Unique design (no fairway bunkers, natural mounding)
- Strategic challenge (accuracy over power)
- Beautiful scenery (lagoons, oaks, historic lighthouse)
- Welcoming atmosphere (public access, friendly staff)

makes Arthur Hills a course that belongs on every serious golfer's Hilton Head bucket list.
