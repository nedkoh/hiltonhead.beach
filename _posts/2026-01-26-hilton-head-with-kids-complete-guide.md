## Essential Planning Tips

### Timing Your Visit

**Spring (April-May):** Mild weather, smaller crowds, lower prices. Ideal for families with school-age children during spring break.

**Summer (June-August):** Peak season with hot, humid weather and larger crowds. Book everything well in advance.

**Early Fall (September-October):** Warm weather continues with reduced crowds. Often considered the sweet spot for family travel.

### Budget Considerations

**Plantation access fees:** Communities like Sea Pines require gate fees (typically around $9 per vehicle). Factor this into your budget for exploring.

**Activity booking:** Popular activities like pirate cruises and dolphin tours fill up quickly. Book at least a week ahead.

**Restaurant reservations:** Essential for dinner, especially in summer. Book early to avoid long waits with hungry kids.

### Packing Essentials

**Beach gear:**
- Reef-safe sunscreen (SPF 30+)
- Rash guards for extended water play
- Beach toys and sand tools
- Portable shade/beach tent

**Practical items:**
- Insect repellent
- Reusable water bottles
- Waterproof phone cases
- Rain jackets (afternoon showers are common)

**For bike rides:**
- Comfortable shoes
- Helmets (if bringing your own)

### Daily Planning Tips

**Beat the heat:** Visit beaches and outdoor attractions in the morning. Plan pool time, naps, or indoor activities for the hottest afternoon hours.

**Grocery delivery:** Services like Instacart deliver directly to vacation rentals. Schedule a delivery for your arrival day so you have supplies waiting.

**Build in downtime:** The heat and humidity can exhaust everyone, especially kids. Schedule rest periods to keep energy levels up.

### Free Entertainment

**Shelter Cove Harbour** hosts free summer fireworks and live music.

**Gregg Russell** performs beloved family-friendly concerts in Harbour Town.

**Beaches** offer unlimited free entertainment for sandcastle building, shell collecting, and wave jumping.

## Safety Tips for Families

**Sun protection:** The South Carolina sun is intense. Apply sunscreen frequently and provide shade options.

**Water safety:** While Hilton Head's surf is generally gentle, always supervise children in the water.

**Wildlife awareness:** Dolphins are fun to watch but should be observed from a distance. Be aware of jellyfish, especially during certain seasons.

**Heat management:** Stay hydrated, take breaks in air conditioning, and watch for signs of heat exhaustion.
