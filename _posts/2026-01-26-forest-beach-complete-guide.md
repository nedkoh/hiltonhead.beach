Forest Beach holds a special place in Hilton Head Island's history as one of the original oceanfront communities developed on the island. Unlike the private, gated plantations that dominate much of Hilton Head, Forest Beach offers an open, walkable neighborhood with a distinctly casual beach vibe. Centered around the iconic Coligny Circle, this three-mile stretch of oceanfront property delivers everything visitors love about a classic beach vacation.

## Understanding Forest Beach

Forest Beach stretches along the southeastern shore of Hilton Head Island, encompassing approximately three miles of pristine Atlantic coastline. The neighborhood divides into two distinct areas separated by Coligny Plaza, the island's original shopping center.

### North Forest Beach

Running from Coligny Circle northward along about a mile of oceanfront to Pope Avenue, North Forest Beach features:

- **Eclectic architecture** ranging from 1950s beach bungalows to modern oceanfront mansions
- **Walking distance to Coligny Plaza** with its 60+ shops and restaurants
- **Direct beach access** at multiple points along the shoreline
- **No HOA fees or gating** for a more relaxed, open atmosphere
- **Every lot within 600 yards of the Atlantic Ocean**

The neighborhood retains much of its original character, with some cottages dating back to the 1950s and 1960s standing alongside newer construction. This mix creates a charm that newer planned communities simply cannot replicate.

### South Forest Beach

Extending from Coligny Circle southward to the Sea Pines Ocean Gate, South Forest Beach offers a different character:

- **More condominium and villa developments** than single-family homes
- **Easy access to Sea Pines** through the nearby gate
- **Quieter atmosphere** than the busier North Forest Beach area
- **Excellent beach access** along the shoreline
- **Mix of vacation rentals and residential properties**

## The Forest Beach Lifestyle

What sets Forest Beach apart from Hilton Head's other vacation areas is its distinctly casual, walkable character. Without gates, passes, or private security, visitors experience a neighborhood that feels more like a traditional beach town than a planned resort community.

### Walkability

Forest Beach ranks among the most walkable areas on Hilton Head Island:

- **Beach access** steps from most accommodations
- **Coligny Plaza** within walking distance of virtually every property
- **Restaurants and shops** along Pope Avenue and surrounding streets
- **Flat terrain** perfect for strolling or biking
- **Connected pathways** linking neighborhoods to attractions

Families often park their car on arrival and do not move it again until departure, enjoying the freedom of exploring on foot or by bicycle.

### Beach Character

The beaches along Forest Beach offer classic Hilton Head Island features:

- **Hard-packed sand** ideal for biking, jogging, and long walks
- **Gentle waves** perfect for swimming and wading with children
- **Excellent shelling** opportunities, especially at low tide
- **Shark teeth hunting** - Forest Beach beaches yield regular finds
- **Lifeguards** on duty at Coligny Beach Park during peak season

The beach width varies with the tides, but at low tide, expansive stretches of sand accommodate everything from sandcastle building to beach volleyball.

## Coligny Beach Park: Forest Beach's Crown Jewel

Coligny Beach Park serves as the primary public beach access point for Forest Beach and one of the most popular destinations on all of Hilton Head Island.

The park represents the heart of Forest Beach's social scene, where visitors and locals mingle in a way unique to this neighborhood.
