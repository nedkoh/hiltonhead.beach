Choosing between Palmetto Dunes and Shipyard Plantation can feel overwhelming when planning your Hilton Head Island vacation. Both gated resort communities offer excellent amenities, beach access, and that signature Lowcountry atmosphere, but they cater to different preferences and vacation styles. This comprehensive comparison will help you determine which resort best matches your family's needs.

## Location Overview

Both resorts occupy prime mid-island real estate, but their positioning creates distinct advantages.

**Palmetto Dunes** stretches along three miles of oceanfront property in the heart of Hilton Head. Its central location provides easy access to attractions throughout the island while maintaining a resort-within-itself atmosphere.

**Shipyard Plantation** sits between Sea Pines and Palmetto Dunes, occupying a compact footprint that emphasizes convenience. Its location near Coligny Beach and Pope Avenue places visitors at the epicenter of the island's most popular shopping and dining districts.

## Beach Access: A Critical Difference

For many families, beach access ranks as the most important factor, and here the two resorts differ significantly.

### Palmetto Dunes Beach Experience

Palmetto Dunes excels in beach access with:

- **Three miles of pristine oceanfront** stretching the length of the community
- **Multiple access points** scattered throughout the resort
- **Oceanfront properties** including homes, villas, condos, and two major resort hotels
- **The Dunes House** serving food and drinks directly on the beach
- **Walking distance to sand** from most accommodations

The expansive beach means you will rarely feel crowded, even during peak summer months. Families can spread out, build sandcastles, and enjoy long beach walks without competing for space.

### Shipyard Beach Experience

Shipyard takes a different approach:

- **Single beach access point** through the Shipyard Beach Club
- **The Sonesta Resort** represents the only true oceanfront property
- **No beachfront bars or restaurants** directly on the sand
- **More concentrated beach area** which can feel crowded during busy periods

While the beach itself is beautiful, visitors seeking oceanfront accommodations or multiple access points may find Shipyard limiting.

**Winner: Palmetto Dunes** for beach lovers who prioritize easy access and variety.

## Golf: Championship Options

Both resorts deliver exceptional golf experiences, though with different approaches.

### Palmetto Dunes Golf

Palmetto Dunes offers three championship 18-hole courses:

- **Robert Trent Jones Oceanfront Course**: The only oceanfront course on Hilton Head, featuring stunning Atlantic views and classic RTJ design elements
- **Arthur Hills Course**: A player-friendly layout with dramatic dune ridges and strategic water features
- **George Fazio Course**: A challenging layout that rewards accurate shot-making

The variety of designs and difficulty levels means golfers of all abilities find suitable options. Course conditioning ranks among the best on the island.

### Shipyard Golf

Shipyard presents a unique format:

- **27 holes across three 9-hole courses**: Brigantine, Clipper, and Galleon
- **Mix-and-match format** allowing different combinations each round
- **George Fazio and Willard Byrd designs** with varied character
- **More intimate atmosphere** with less congestion

The shorter courses work well for golfers who prefer quicker rounds or want to play just nine holes.

**Winner: Draw** - Palmetto Dunes wins for serious golfers seeking full championship courses, while Shipyard appeals to those wanting flexibility and shorter round options.

## Tennis: World-Class Facilities

Both resorts have earned recognition for their tennis programs.
